<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
	In this project, we model a cloth material as a system of discrete masses and springs, simulating its physical evolution within several environments in real time via numerical integration. We implement collisions between the cloth and rigid external objects as well as internal collisions among components of the cloth itself. Finally, we create a variety of shader programs to give the cloth an upgraded appearance, complete with personalized shading and textures.
</p>
<br>

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and Springs</h2>
<p>
	To simulate our cloth, we construct a grid of point masses and connect them with three different types of springs. Structural springs connect adjacent point masses horizontally and vertically while shearing springs link point masses diagonally across the structural springs. Bending springs, on the other hand, attach every two point masses both in the horizontal and vertical direction, leaving a gap to allow more flexibility. In the following images, we toggle various spring constraints and observe the resulting structural changes to the cloth mesh.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via Numerical Integration</h2>
<p>
	Setting the cloth in motion first entails computing all of the external and spring correction forces acting on the point masses in the mesh. Since we want the bending springs to stretch more liberally than the structural and shearing springs, we multiply its spring constant by a factor of 0.2. After obtaining the relevant force vectors, we apply Verlet integration, an explicit numerical integrator, to update the positions of the point masses for the next time step. The Verlet equation is as follows:
</p>

<div align="middle">
  <img src="images/verlet.png" align="middle" width="650px"/>
</div>

<p>
	where $x_t$ is the 3D position of the point mass at time $t$, $dt$ is the duration of a time step, and $d$ is the damping term. In order to prevent the springs from becoming excessively deformed as the simulation progresses, we further constrain the mass-spring mesh such that each spring's length can stretch by at most 10% of its resting length per time step. The following animation shows the wireframe of the cloth falling from an initial horizontal position to a resting state in which it hangs from two pinned points.
</p>

<br>
<div align="middle">
  <img src="images/part2-1.gif" align="middle" height="250px"/>
  <figcaption align="middle">Wireframe Falling</figcaption>
</div>
<br>

<p>
  As we increase the spring constant parameter, the movement of the cloth becomes more rigid and less bouncy since the springs require a greater amount of force to stretch the same distance. At a low spring constant, the cloth appears to ripple on its way down and exhibits more stretchiness. It also has much finer horizontal creases at the top. Once it reaches the bottom, the cloth continues to bounce and hangs relatively low once it reaches a resting state. In contrast, the cloth holds its structural integrity and behaves similarly to a swinging sheet of paper with a high spring constant. At the bottom, it does not bounce much and simply hangs at rest with minimal stretching.
</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>
  Constructing a dense cloth allows it to stretch longer distances, as the force of gravity on the increased collective mass of the cloth pulls harder on the cloth's springs. This leads to a lower dip between the pinned masses and an overall longer appearance. At a low density, the cloth hardly expands, creating a shorter look akin to that of the cloth produced by the stiff spring constant above.
</p>

<p>
	Aggressive damping causes the cloth to fall at a much slower pace but it also takes less time to come to rest. With a low damping factor, the cloth falls rapidly and proceeds to bounce back and forth for some time before eventually arriving at its resting state. Regardless of the damping value, however, the two cloths appear identical once they have completely stopped moving.

<h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling Collisions with Other Objects</h2>
<p>
	At this point, we can constrain our point mass position updates to account for collisions with external objects. For every point mass at each time step, we check if it has just passed through the surface of a sphere or plane and nudge it back slightly above the surface if so. This gives the appearance of the cloth landing smoothly on the object.
</p>
<p>
  Similar to the hanging cloth from the previous section, increasing the stiffness of the springs makes the cloth move in a more rigid manner. With a low spring constant, the cloth stretches nearly all the way around the bottom of the ball before coming to a resting droopy state with many wrinkles. The default moderate spring constant allows the cloth to wrap most of the way around the ball, ultimately yielding fewer wrinkles and a bit more lateral stiffness near the top end of the ball. Lastly, a high spring stiffness forces the cloth to stretch to a lesser extent and arrive at rest with just a few large creases. The resulting wings that extend beyond either side of the ball give the scene a dumpling-esque look.

<h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling Self-Collisions</h2>
<p>
	In addition to colliding with external objects, we can update our model to allow the cloth to collide with itself and produce a folding effect without clipping artifacts. If two point masses are sufficiently close to one another, we repel them away from each other very slightly such that the cloth does not cave in on itself as the simulation advances. A naive implementation of this technique would be prohibitively slow for a real-time simulation, so we construct a 3D spatial hash map to partition the point masses into spatial buckets in the model space. This expedites the simulation by making nearby point mass position lookups a constant-time operation rather than a linear-time one.
</p>

<br>
<div align="middle">
  <img src="images/part4-1.gif" align="middle" width="300px"/>
  <figcaption align="middle">Self-Collision</figcaption>
</div>
<br>

<p>
  We observe in the following animations that a low density leads to a coarser cloth with few creases while a high density yields a bouncy and fluid cloth with many small wrinkles. Intuitively, a low-density cloth has a tougher time seamlessly bumping itself out of place when it self-collides due to the limitations in mobility that a low number of point masses entails. A cloth with many point masses can exhibit finer perturbations and more complex folds.
</p>

<div align="middle">
	<table cellpadding="10">
		<tr>
		  <td>
        <img src="images/part4-2.gif" align="middle" height="260px"/>

<p>
  Interestingly, it appears that varying the spring constant induces inverse behavior relative to adjusting the density in the same direction. Hence, a relatively small spring constant produces a springy cloth riddled with lots of tiny wrinkles while a larger spring stiffness forces the cloth to bend less with just a few long creases.

<h2 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders</h2>
<p>
	A shader is a program that computes lighting and color effects during the rendering of a 3D scene according to the stylistic vision of the artist/programmer. We use OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) to write vertex and fragment shaders for the cloth and other objects in our simulations. To render images within this framework, the vertex shader first processes individual vertices as a collection of associated vectors (position, normal, tangent, etc.), mapping them from world space to model space, then normalizing them and adjusting their direction if desired. These output vectors from the vertex shader are fed in as input to a fragment shader which then calculates the output color of a particular fragment of an object according to the programmed lighting effect. Together, these pipelined shaders allow us to efficiently render complex visual scenes.
</p>
<p>
  As discussed throughout the course, the Blinn-Phong shading model is broken into three distinct, linear parts. The ambient component represents the small sum of light scattered about the scene and subsequently reflected off the surface of an object. Diffuse lighting comes from direct uniform reflection off the rougher parts of an object's surface while specular highlights depict shiny portions of the object. Below, we show an animation of the cloth dropping on the ball for each of the individual Blinn-Phong components, followed by all three combined.

<p>
  Bump mapping involves tweaking the normal vectors of an object such that the fragment shader produces the illusion of elevated contours on rendered surfaces according to the provided texture. In our implementation, we opted to induce “bumps” for a particular fragment based on a height map defined by the magnitude of the red channel of the sampled location of the texture. Displacement mapping is an extension of bump mapping in which we physically alter the position of the vertices in the vertex shader to reflect the height map within the geometry of the object as well. For this section, we apply a leafy texture to the cloth and ball to obtain the following results.

  In the following images, we show bump mapping on the sphere in the left column and displacement mapping in the right column. In the first row, we use a horizontal and vertical resolution of 16 while the second row has a resolution of 128 across both dimensions. We observe that raising the resolution leads to the emergence of finer details for both shaders, especially near the visible edges of the sphere. For displacement mapping in particular, we see a drastic increase in the amount of lifted, spiky leaf details in the sphere's geometry.
